[00:00:00] **Chris Williamson:** We are both fans of Charlie Hooper, and he says that when somebody asks you, what do you do, you have the opportunity to hook lots of different things in. So if someone was to ask you why do you do what you do? What's the single thread that ties together all of the things that you do? What would you say that?

[00:00:23] **David Laid:** That's interesting. I feel like there's been like an evolution like throughout that because

[00:00:30] just what I do, I guess It's like changed like over time because like now like like broadly speaking like on the surface Like I make like youtube like fitness oriented videos But I think that started when I was like 13 or 14 years old Like I got into like weightlifting and then I took a lot of pictures of my progress Made a transformation video that ended up going viral And then I just like started making a youtube channel just with like my friends in the gym Just making random videos and working out and then I guess [00:01:00] I started being more interested in making Cinematic ish like content and just making it more like I don't know sophisticated like higher quality like etc like more artistic and You Yeah, I guess I just enjoy making videos that I just enjoy making.

[00:01:19] **Chris Williamson:** Do you wish sometimes that your entrance into the world of virality, social media, YouTube, hadn't been so tightly defined based on the way that you look, the gym, or do you like integrate that as part of your history perfectly fine?

[00:01:41] **David Laid:** I'd say so. I mean, I'd say at an earlier point, maybe like years and years and years ago, it was to the point where there was like a, like, I guess a slight like toxicity component to it because the whole reason that I got into working out was because of like very like generic stereotypical insecurities as being like extremely skinny, feeling all that.

[00:01:59] And then [00:02:00] as I started getting More and more progress in the gym. And then that obviously gave me like a self esteem boost. I felt a lot better about myself. And then I would like take pictures. And then obviously when people take pictures, oftentimes they just want to like maximize it to get it, you know, the best lighting angles, et cetera.

[00:02:15] And then I got to a point where maybe like a few years into working out where I had just a decent bit enough of muscle to get pictures that look like semi decent. Right. But not in those pictures, like in real life, like without like a pump or whatever. I remember just like feeling like, still like very like.

[00:02:31] Just like skinny and insecure and then it was like a problem because even say like my senior year in high school I remember I would just wear hoodies just all the time because if you're wearing like a big baggy hoodie You can't like exactly tell like like the size of an individual even though at

[00:02:45] **Chris Williamson:** this stage You're probably one of the biggest guys in

[00:02:48] **David Laid:** yeah, I mean I wasn't like Gargantuan or anything so but I definitely I I look a good normal reasonable human being with like an acceptable amount of like muscle tone, right?

[00:02:56] but still in my head there was like this crazy just distortion body [00:03:00] dysmorphia and Then eventually the way that transferred over to social media is it was like that thing just amplified even more in terms of just needing To look as good as I possibly could like in the pictures and videos. People are now scrutinizing you for it.

[00:03:11] Yeah, so if like I'd take a picture with someone and then my physique didn't look like as good as like I thought it would like in my own pictures that I would take or just by myself in like particular curated environments that would definitely wreak havoc on my well being and that was. Definitely suboptimal, but as more and more time went by, I feel like that general complex just naturally, like, dissolved, and there's been a bit more peace.

[00:03:34] **Chris Williamson:** Where are you at now with, you know, because you're still, what, you're 24? Uh, just turned 25. Right, okay, so you've been on the internet for longer than I have, despite being 10 years younger than me. Mm hmm. Right? Given the fact that you have had this long career from basically, when was, when did that first video go viral?

[00:03:52] 17? 18?

[00:03:55] **David Laid:** The age that I was? I was about 17.

[00:03:56] **Chris Williamson:** Yeah. So, you know, a good chunk of time that you've [00:04:00] spent with an awful lot of eyes on you on the internet, all of this has been based around the way that you look, you know, this is coming out the back end of the like aesthetic bro, like Jim's era type thing. How have you managed to dispense with, or how much have you managed to get rid of that body dysmorphia, that sense of your sense of self worth being attached to the way that you look, your leanness, your size?

[00:04:23] **David Laid:** I think the way that that dissolution happened to whatever degree it has happened was through just so many years on end or such a prolonged period of time of just feeling such internal like discomfort and dissonance and just an overall sense of like discomfort in my actual day to day life having to just like micromanage.

[00:04:42] Just my own like self image how I think I look yada yada This is that and then it just got to the point where that was just so unsatisfying To operate in that way that the more and more I would distance myself from that like organically as a byproduct of like [00:05:00] achieving a certain Like understanding of how that makes me feel then I would just notice it would just Not feel that way anymore, but even like throughout the years like at times I would have Situations where I could just see my brain Re entering previous thought patterns that I did when I was like fully ensconced in that mindset But back when I was fully ensconced in that mindset That was literally my like reality as I was like having those thoughts and feelings But now that previous thought pattern still exists but it it exists within a broader understanding so that when it arises I could just recognize its arisal and then It'll just go away.

[00:05:35] And then, um, just like, I don't know, at peace or I like feel fine. Like there's like no like issues really. So I don't know. I didn't like necessarily implement like, just like a strategic like plan or like take any steps or like create, I don't know, like a mental hygienic discipline to do that. It's just, it just sort of just organically.

[00:05:53] Just happened after just like contemplation and stuff.

[00:05:56] **Chris Williamson:** Talk to me about the introspection and the self work that you've done over the last few [00:06:00] years.

[00:06:04] Just to interject there man, like you're a you're a young guy, right? You're 25. Mm hmm. I was like an adult infant at 25 and the way that you're talking about letting go, releasing difficult challenges that come up is very mature, especially for somebody that's had Broadly the internet world at their feet for quite a long time and I'm fascinated to work out how you go from That aesthetic bro thing to now Still a relatively young age taking value in different stuff What have been the practices the thought patterns the influences that have got you?

[00:06:38] **David Laid:** I'd say one of the main reasons that happened is just my natural disposition of being extremely introverted. So for me, I Spent yada yada Like we all know like how like introversion works like basically so for me Just, just long periods of time just by myself, just thinking about shit. Are you an only child?[00:07:00]

[00:07:00] No, I have three brothers. Okay. Just thinking, just obviously listening to just lots of podcasts, like lots of great thinkers, just borrowing like thought patterns from other people and just building this larger like conception, like in my head and then contrasting that with my own insights and things that I've just experienced.

[00:07:17] And yeah, just, just lots of, just, just lots of like thinking. Cause I feel like that's how most things are like typically like resolved. Like, there's an idea that, I forget, like, there's lots of people that talk about this, I'm sure you've heard people talk about this too, but if you, if you want to, like, for example, like, are you familiar with, like, Naval Ravikant, like, him talking about, like, prescriptions, or, like, if he's spoken to, uh, an individual, like, like, Kapil Gupta, podcast.

[00:07:43] Oh, he has? No. A very long time ago.

[00:07:45] **Chris Williamson:** Who? Kapil Gupta. No way. Correct. Has he actually? Yeah, the No Prescriptions Prescriptions guy. Was it

[00:07:50] **David Laid:** an audio only podcast? Correct. Yeah. So, I mean, you get that whole idea, like, basically, I feel like so if an individual is like struggling with like any source of like [00:08:00] body dysmorphia, image issues, like etc.

[00:08:02] One line of thought is like, okay, like I have an issue, like I have a problem, I have like anxiety, I have distress, I have all these like things going on. So one school of thought is like, okay. Let me, okay, I have issues, right? I need to fix issues, so let me, like, implement, like, certain, like, things and regimes to, like, combat these problems, which is, like, useful in moderation to a degree, but I feel like for just a really, really deep, internal, authentic transformation, you can't do that by following the game.

[00:08:29] Just certain like, Oh, let me just write down like in my like gratitude journal, like 15 minutes a day, like every single day, like, let me just like have this like mantra, like meditation kind of pattern, maybe that works for some people to some degree, but in a certain kind of way, there's a type of like insincerity that goes with that because you become obsessed with doing the, doing the, the surface level generic action to get out of your state of distress, as opposed to just sitting and being in the distress without any agenda and just, just being there.

[00:08:59] And. [00:09:00] In that state just naturally you somehow just wiggle out of or dissolve or just Transcend like the issue per se or you don't even transcend it You could just understand it on a deeper level and it's that deeper understanding that gives like health, I suppose, if that makes any sense. It does.

[00:09:19] **Chris Williamson:** Well, I think that an interesting question might be how many of the strategies that you use to deal with the things that you don't like about yourself or about your life are not helping you to deal with them.

[00:09:32] but are helping you to escape from them. So yeah,

[00:09:34] **David Laid:** so I just remember, so I remember, so when I was like young, when I was like 13, 14 ish, like 12 or whatever, I was like very insecure, I was like skinny, whatever, right? So like I saw like, you know, muscular people that I look up to, I was like, oh, like I want that, right?

[00:09:47] So then I followed a bunch of people, I gained like a lot of inspiration, then I did like what I needed to do to like build my physique. And then I think I was around the age of like 18, 19, 20, like sometime around that time. And then I think that's when Jordan [00:10:00] Peterson like first started popping off. And um, I was like listening to a lot of his content and I was like, whoa, there's something about this like resonates so much.

[00:10:07] I remember like feeling just that I. We just like have like certain just interesting ideas are like things going on in my brain, but they couldn't like come out just right. And then when I would listen to someone like Jordan Peterson speak, I had a very specific admiration for the, his ability to so precisely with perfect congruence of what's happening internally and what he's saying externally to be at a one to one ratio with just like.

[00:10:27] Music the orchestral grade precision with like his like delivery just almost like irregardless of what he was like saying It's like the structure not the concept of a speech that I just had like an admiration for in addition to the things That obviously said as well So then that I feel like launched my brain into wanting to just like develop in those like general regions like categories and stuff So I would just listen to like so many other people, you know, the Sam Harris's Alan Wallace, etc like all these like different people so then I remember like Reaching a point of like, I was like 20, 21 ish.

[00:10:59] And then [00:11:00] I had a general feeling of just like the whole body dysmorphia, yada, yada, all this like stuff was just like catching up to me. All these like generic, whatever, like all these are problems that me and like so many people deal with. And then I went down like the prescription path, right? And the prescription path would have been like, like I started going into yoga all the time.

[00:11:16] And then I had this like huge ego complex, like showing up on time, like doing all like my poses, like extremely, extremely well. Cause I'm like, if I'm like doing this. Right, and then I also like I'll like sit down like I'll meditate in the morning for 30 minutes Whatever. I was like so obsessed and excited to do that because obviously, you know The thought pattern is doing these things will like alleviate me and like get me out of like my problems or whatever So then I feel like it's a very common thing for like so many people to do and then they become obsessed with doing that I became obsessed with doing that and then I felt like huge bursts of dopamine throughout that right because I'm like Oh checkbox like yoga session finish like this thing finished like this like food like eaten right and I would just feel like so excited but it was almost like a short term just pleasure seeking fixation on like doing that and then it actually didn't like really like solve anything underneath

[00:11:59] **Chris Williamson:** [00:12:00] you've still got the existing problem okay so you've got in the first instance an issue with body dysmorphia or a dissatisfaction with the way that you look you fix that by finding people that you like the way that they look and modeling what they do then you find people that you admire the way that they think and you compare the way that you think to the way that they think You then start to model off of the way that they think what are the similarities?

[00:12:25] Between or what is it that you were looking for? Do you think in both camps of people like what is it that Ziz and Jordan Peterson have got in common that seduced you?

[00:12:35] **David Laid:** Great line. What are the things that Ziz and Jordan Peterson have in common? I say that it's the you to me you inattainment of something That I for whatever reason deemed to me deemed to be admirable and non negotiably necessary for me to have And in ziz's obvious case, it's you know muscles, uh, jordan peterson brain, etc.

[00:12:59] [00:13:00] But so it's just their Accomplishment of something. Yeah, and I feel like you could almost Tie that into I don't know if you could tie that into the general concept of like masculinity, but I Yeah, I'd say to me. It's just something that they like achieved that I for whatever reason just wanted To have what

[00:13:23] **Chris Williamson:** sounds to me like if you want to roll masculinity into this, you're trying from first principles to come up with like, what is a modern renaissance man, you know, how do we have the body, the brains, the humility, the benevolence, the altruism, the insight, the self awareness, you know, the power, but not the tyranny, the money, but not the greed, you know, how do we hold all of these things together.

[00:13:50] One of the challenges that I've been talking about a lot on the show at the moment. is finding a firm place for men to stand in the modern world. And this isn't just good for men, right? Because if you have [00:14:00] good, benevolent, strong men, they make pretty good partners, usually, on average. Like, they're good for the women, as well.

[00:14:05] And they're good for the community, and they're good for the society, and they're good for the civilization, and the GDP, and the economics, and all the rest of the stuff. Given the fact that you have spent a lot of time chronically online for the last ten years, What's your conception of male role models at the moment, the challenge of masculinity?

[00:14:26] Why do you think it is that a lot of young men are feeling lost, uh, and requiring more and more of these role models? I

[00:14:35] **David Laid:** think there's many different, like, interpretations. Like, one school of thought or camp is like, Oh, there's There's been a disruption of the nuclear family unit and there's like some conspiratorial reasons for that some non conspiratorial reasons because you can go under the hypothesis that to, you know, have a more or less successful upbringing you want to stand a nuclear family unit mom and dad and then without being like fragmented fractured then that creates all sorts of problems.

[00:14:57] So if that is the case, [00:15:00] then the quote unquote child boy like in this instance isn't getting a certain type of isn't getting like a healthy proper dose of. Masculine energy, like within like the household under the assumption that the household is fragmented for whatever reasons, then that need still needs to be satiated and because it's not being satiated at home due to the easy access to the internet, then that role models will be found like online.

[00:15:24] Yep. So like inbuilt in like intrinsic, like in like the human condition is like that, like need for that, like kind of energy. And if it's not being like given at home, it's going to be needs to be supplemented elsewhere. In all this case online and depending on the. Maybe maturity level of the individual or just how the individual is wired that they like certain people gravitate towards These types of online figures other rules like rotate in this I mean not rotate resonate or connect with other people that they find on the internet and I think that the reason that people like z's and like jordan peterson and like that are um influential and have like resonance [00:16:00] is because they're Arguably supplementing that need that a lot of people aren't getting in the stereotypically standard classic home nuclear family esque kind of way.

[00:16:11] **Chris Williamson:** Yes, yes, I think yes. I also think that even if you do have a nuclear family, the rules and procedures that the generation before ours had, you know, if your dad grew up and never had the internet until you were born, how is he going to be able to fold in understanding the way that social media works, understanding the way that online dating works, the crazy, crazy changes that we've seen with regards to men's roles, the Me Too movement, all of this stuff, I think that it.

[00:16:44] Even the best meaning father in the world from the previous generation might struggle to have the language to be able to communicate with a kid that is growing up.

[00:16:52] **David Laid:** Yeah, no, for sure. Times are changing so fast. Things are changing so quickly that, you know, the previous, like, rule set or [00:17:00] whatever. Although it may have like certain fundamental pillars or parameters that will be universally applicable for any timeline whatsoever, when things change as they inevitably do, like things, approaches need to be just like micromanaged and nuancedly like tweaked and then no one knows like exactly to what degree that needs to be done.

[00:17:17] Like it's so easy to overshoot or undershoot. And because the rules like haven't been made yet, we're essentially figuring out like on the fly, like what's like

[00:17:24] **Chris Williamson:** happening. Correct. I also think that it's more than, uh, perhaps just a micro tweak. I think that the last 30 to 40 years has been. Bit of a left turn as soon as you introduce the internet one interesting thing that I was considering on the plane ride over here For the guys that didn't come up Living on ziz and that aesthetics bro era a lot of that was about pulling girls at festivals It was sort of quite chauvinistic.

[00:17:48] It was Harmless and funny and self deprecating there was still a lot of that like sort of gym flirtation energy in there How [00:18:00] do you think? In 2023, given the politics that we have at the moment, given the hypersensitivity around approaching girls in the gym, given the advent of Me Too, how do you think if you deposited Ziz in 2023, that kind of content would be received now?

[00:18:17] Do you think that he would survive without cancellation? Someone

[00:18:21] **David Laid:** like Ziz? I think that he would survive without cancellation, probably. Because, I think, like, extremist people like that That I mean they garner like a certain like audience like the more niche or extreme you could be like you'll cultivate an audience and obviously like a lot of people also dislike you as well and that'll like add to your benefit in terms of like social media like expansion.

[00:18:42] So I mean there's like plenty of people that many people deem to be detestable but they're still extremely prevalent on the internet so. No, I mean, I think all things considered I don't think this would be like cancelled per se today because I mean There's so many other people that are like taking on like this is ask manly energy and just like passing, [00:19:00] you know Taking the torch that he you know passed on that are still living in those general like kinds of ways So I think that I think he would probably flourish just fine Objectively speaking

[00:19:10] **Chris Williamson:** talking about this.

[00:19:11] I'm fascinated about this trajectory right that that you've gone on specifically What changes? If you were able to create what you think the world of men that are around about your age need right now, in terms of influences and influences, what do you wish that you could see more of, in terms of the sort of content that's out there, in terms of the kind of messaging, the kind of values?

[00:19:35] The sort of things that men should be aspiring toward and the things that they should stop aspiring toward as well. What would you try and prescribe?

[00:19:42] **David Laid:** I think, generally speaking, like, a reduction in materialism would probably be a good thing. And I think the additional emphasis on just developing, like, a competence in, like, any domain whatsoever, whether it's, like, pottery, you know, exercising, working out, like, whatever it [00:20:00] is.

[00:20:00] So it would be, I think it would be better to shine more of a light on People's genuine like ability and attainments and skill level in whatever idiosyncratic or generic just pursuit and endeavor is, and just have appreciation for that in and of itself without any. With a significantly less emphasis on the periphery of the tangible material assets of that that that type of success could like yield So

[00:20:31] **Chris Williamson:** homo Z on an episode that I did with him a couple of weeks ago said far more people are kept poor and stupid By their ego than get rich off it Yeah And you know he made this great point that if you are somebody that considers yourself to be a high performer That is pushing and always trying to grow and you're able to retain your ego It's because you're in the wrong room.

[00:20:52] And his point was, even though he's now worth 100 mil, he's got this acquisition. com, he's doing these massive deals, he's [00:21:00] permanently in rooms where he is both the stupidest and poorest person in the room. How can you allow an ego to proliferate and grow when you're permanently the lowest rung of the ladder?

[00:21:10] And his argument was basically that ego comes from people artificially walling off the size of the pond that they get into. to allow themselves to always be the biggest

[00:21:21] **David Laid:** fish. But also I feel like it comes down to their deepest, most fundamental motivation. Because, for example, you could take someone like Alex.

[00:21:27] He desperately is wired to do something and wants to do something. Just like work, build his empire, business, whatever. That's like his sort of thing. So he just, he simply needs to do that to be satiated, happy, and like satisfied. Right? So that's just what he's on. And in order to be able to do that as effectively as he possibly can manage, that would.

[00:21:46] Necessitate and require a very high level of like self awareness and obviously self awareness is the antithesis to ego So that's just simply what he what he wants to do and then you could take someone else That is like the small pawn like ego situation their primary most [00:22:00] fundamental desire isn't doing something for its own sake or Any, you know deeper reason like that.

[00:22:05] It's simply towards the The growth and maintenance of the ego and that's just simply that's just what their motivation is Like they're simply they're more interested in like having a certain self image of themselves And doing everything to convince other people of that image and commit themselves of that image because to them, that's more important than other things.

[00:22:22] So it's just like a different hierarchy of like priorities, right? So like the lower level development psyche is going to want to favor just egotistical ish. Types of things.

[00:22:34] **Chris Williamson:** How do you square this circle with the person that's listening to this and going, hang on, you're David fucking laid like you are Mr.

[00:22:42] Instagram, zzz era. Like how have you made that change? How have you made that transition from being somebody who outwardly, it seemed like it was, and you mentioned yourself, it was to satiate your feelings of insufficiency, to now get to a place where, I mean, how many videos have you posted [00:23:00] on. YouTube in the last year, probably less than 12.

[00:23:03] How many Instagram posts have you done in the last year? Less than 20. It's been at a decline, but my point being that from where I can see, and I didn't get to hear you on podcasts before, I think that your trajectory in terms of how you're sounding to me, in terms of the things that you're thinking about is fucking phenomenal.

[00:23:19] I would have happily taken the sabbatical from social media. If what it's resulted in is you being like this. But, how do you get to that point? There are guys on the internet that are watching the ego lifter, the materialist Ferrari driver, the Richard Mill, Red Louboutin's bottom table at Club Liv in Miami.

[00:23:43] What is it that can drag those people out of that? Or what would you say to those, like, young guys, if you could? Why should they be bothered about this thing which seems hard and difficult and nuanced and no one gives a fuck about, except for their own sense of existential self worth?

[00:23:58] **David Laid:** I think, I mean, I think a lot of [00:24:00] those people that like operate like that, like they have like a vague understanding that like maybe the way in which they're operating from a lot of other people's points of view is like seen as like negative, egotistical, immature, like, et cetera.

[00:24:11] So they have like that, like general, like awareness. And there may be aware that they just satisfy, you know, society at a whole, you know, expectations of them. They would maybe like cease or halt or like slow down on some of that behavior or like, you know, outgrow it or et cetera. They're like aware of that, but they just.

[00:24:26] They just they just don't want to do it because going back to what I was saying before that's just simply like they're just more Interested in doing that that's that's like where the current level of like their development is So in the same way like to me the only the way that I outgrew whatever like I agree like whatever time like it came From just like just organic like introspection So going back to kind of what I was like saying in the beginning Like you just simply you need to just examine you need you just need to just like like look at what you're doing It's like look at how you're living and look at how you're operating And just like, like dissect it as much as you can and be as like, be [00:25:00] honest with yourself, obviously, and like, look at it.

[00:25:01] And I feel like if you're genuinely and sincerely doing that, right, you're more than likely to realize how that pattern of that style of like living is just disadvantageous for your absolute best interest. And through coming to that realization, you just organically stop doing that. You don't have to do different things.

[00:25:17] Yeah. You don't have to discipline yourself to stop doing like, Oh, I really want to do it, but I want to go to this. But I can't like, no, you just won't have that desire. And that's the best place to be at. Because why do you want to, like, it's just where you gotta arrive, you know?

[00:25:29] **Chris Williamson:** So there's, my favorite ever blog post of all time is by a guy called Kyle Eschenroder, and it's called What Do You Want to Want?

[00:25:34] And he talks about the difference between wants and what we want to want. So wants are societal programming, they're paths of least resistance, they're the way that you've dealt with past trauma, they are all of those things. What you want to want involves you going in and reprogramming your desires. You want to end up at a place where what you want Is what you want to want and he uses this example of the fact that If you don't go in and [00:26:00] program your desires The best thing that you can hope for is to be a rich successful or famous slave A slave to the impulses of your body the confused biochemical signals that you get The desires of the people around you and when I read that and this is you know, five years ago now, I thought What do I want to want in life?

[00:26:19] Genuinely, what do I want to want? Like, I have the opportunity. Laws of thermodynamics and, like, a little bit of economics restricting, I can want anything. This is what we're talking about here. We're talking about digging away at all of the layers of ego and predisposition and expectation that you've built up and getting yourself to something that's firmer.

[00:26:44] Getting yourself to something which is what you want to want.

[00:26:50] **David Laid:** Yeah, I mean, I, I think there's a lot of validity in that, because basically, like, what you're saying is, like, you, a person wants certain things, and then maybe [00:27:00] he realizes to some degree, like, these just kind of, this maybe, maybe isn't my best interest.

[00:27:03] Like, silly, like, little hypothesis lurking in the back of the mind. Okay, so, if I'm an autonomous being, I could, I could more or less curate or decide what I want to want. So, if that's a possibility, let's just look, broadly speaking, what are some of the things that. Would maybe be in more of a best interest for me to one and then you decide those things and you fixate in that pattern.

[00:27:22] I mean fixate in that direction and even if you you could argue that that's still prescription ask to some degree, but then you could also say that doing that is better than just continuing wanting those like suboptimal things. So if that if that's what gets you moving in that direction, then it's

[00:27:38] **Chris Williamson:** absolutely yeah.

[00:27:39] And direction is more important than speed, right? Like you can be going as fast as possible. And it actually takes you further away from the destination. This is something that a lot of people, I call it the, uh, Manopause. Um, which is mid twenties toward late twenties. A lot of guys, it seems like you had yours earlier, realize that a lot of the values that they hold, a lot of the things that [00:28:00] previously they took a sense of self worth from, that the world told them that they should value, They don't make them feel fulfilled anymore.

[00:28:06] And they go, Oh, fuck. Like, I got toward the top of this mountain, and I realized that it was the wrong mountain that I climbed, and actually I was supposed to be on that one over there. And it's difficult, because in order to get to that one, you need to go back down this one that you've already climbed.

[00:28:22] You need to dispense with the stuff. that you've got rid of?

[00:28:25] **David Laid:** This is why I think introversion is such a cheat code, because

[00:28:29] **Chris Williamson:** like, I feel like You're less at the mercy of other people's desires. Because even like

[00:28:32] **David Laid:** for me, I noticed that if I'm, the more frequently and the more for a sustained period of time, I'm involved in certain just patterns of behavior, oftentimes socially or just, just what I do in general, you just become locked in those patterns and it becomes more difficult.

[00:28:45] You have more of like a narrow perspective. So, you know, the brain's malleable, it just gets programmed in that way and you're just kind of operating that way. So for me, a lot of like the best insights that I've gotten are like times when I like completely just like fully detached and just entered this weird like meditative just like flow [00:29:00] state of just being just so just alone and then yeah, so it's just I feel like, yeah, I mean, almost a prescriptive thing that you could say is to just stop.

[00:29:11] I mean, that's what they say, like psychedelics do. I think I heard someone on Joe Rogan talk about. He had like a nice analogy. It's like the brain is like. Like a hill covered in snow and then when skis go down the snow That's a thought behavior pattern, etc And then the more you have it the more deeper that groove gets and then the psychedelics they just like wipe the snow, right?

[00:29:27] so Detaching from society detaching and you know reclusing yourself for a period of time. It's like a Microform of like a psychedelic snow flattening kind of

[00:29:36] **Chris Williamson:** thing because you're removing the external inputs as best You can removing

[00:29:40] **David Laid:** the input stopping behavior patterns Just allowing yourself to see things differently and have different patterns

[00:29:44] **Chris Williamson:** for the people who are thinking about monk mode Um, there's a really great blog post by Illimitable Man, if you just search Illimitable Man, Monk Mode.

[00:29:54] Thirteen years old now, I think. Uh, but it's really, really great. There's the three I's. Isolation, [00:30:00] introspection, some other shit. There's a third one. Anyway, that, I really, really enjoyed that blog post, and that was good to me. One thing that I do find, and this is me almost directly, like, telling it to Hamza, my friend.

[00:30:15] Monk Mode can be taken to an extreme. And you can do, you can obsess over isolated self development too much.

[00:30:24] **David Laid:** Yeah, the way that I, the way that I would look at that is like, monk mode could become a detrimental extreme when monk mode becomes hyper prescriptionized. Because the, I feel like the way it becomes an extreme is like, you're like, okay.

[00:30:36] I want to self improve myself just monk mode, right? So then you become obsessed with rpe10 just maxing out like monk mode. So there the true fundamental motivation isn't Understanding things the true fundamental motivation is to feel good about yourself for maxing out monk mode for the egotistical grad because yeah, I mean like just how we talked about how You say young individuals like materialists Programmed by society like wrong values and stuff The reason [00:31:00] that they're doing that is because that satisfies their ego that's been programmed and programmed into them, right?

[00:31:04] Someone going all out monk mode, right? Accelerably abstaining from all of that, right? They're they're same energy. No, they have the they have the exact same ego but the subtle difference is that they could feel a sense of just like moral superiority correct because like i'm better than you because all of that But in reality, they have the same ego, it's just transmuted into something else.

[00:31:24] This

[00:31:25] **Chris Williamson:** is a very important point that I want everybody to take home, which is, you can justify any kind of activity as being the thing that is going to give you a sense of Dopaminergic, I achieved the next thing. Just because you have switched one type of obsession for another type of obsession does not necessarily mean that that obsession is more holistic.

[00:31:48] You could argue, given the choice between being obsessed with the gym and being obsessed with taking heroin, that the gym is objectively a better obsession to have. But if you're going to get really down to zero, [00:32:00] what we're talking about is, how can we sit with the discomfort of not being enough? How can we sit with the discomfort of not having an obsession at all?

[00:32:10] What does that feel like? And this is like almost a psychedelic point, right? To get rid of, to get rid of the desire to need those things overall.

[00:32:22] **David Laid:** You know, I feel like that, That's a very good point. The idea that like, yeah, like doing heroin or whatever, or like, versus like working out in the gym, like it's a similar kind of egotistical pursuit, but due to like, I mean, obviously the working out, it's like the healthier thing.

[00:32:37] And the externality

[00:32:38] **Chris Williamson:** of one

[00:32:39] **David Laid:** is very different. Exactly. That's what I'm getting at. The externality could be like drastically different. For example, like you could be addicted to heroin or you could be addicted to just like rampant entrepreneurial, just. Financial just hedonism splurge and that and then again due to how society is it's celebrated yada yada blah blah But like you said it is the most important thing is realizing that Fundamentally, [00:33:00] you're a slave to an egotistical construction with either one and the goal is to transcend that even though You're egotistical construction that you're feeding is Societally rewarded right?

[00:33:12] So that's a trap that you could really really fall into So the key is you need to go a little lower than that

[00:33:16] **Chris Williamson:** Yep, I agree. It's a very difficult thing to do to let go of something which is not destructive, reinforced, praised, gives you accolades, and really importantly, like you said, gives you the moral high ground.

[00:33:32] It's like, look at me, look at how awakened I am. This is, there's a term that you I might not be familiar with called spiritual bypass. So have you heard of this before? Yeah, so um, people that go to South America, take a ton of ayahuasca, come back and proselytize, extol the virtues of this amazing peak experience that they've had.

[00:33:55] Don't do any of the integration, don't do any of the self work, go back to being the same, maybe not even [00:34:00] a piece of shit, but just go back to being the same person that they were before and then go and do it again. Right, that's spiritual bypass or better to I prefer spiritual tourism that you can go and like visit it like a holiday home and come back and forget about all of the things that you learned the goal is to integrate each of these different points here.

[00:34:17] So one thing that was very formative for me and I'm interested to find out about your experience as well. I had a pretty serious back injury. About four years ago, got into CrossFit, uh, was way stronger than my body could deal with, and managed to slip two discs. I found Stu McGill, number one back pain specialist on the planet.

[00:34:38] I know that you have worked with him too. How difficult was it for you, as somebody who had a lot of his self worth wrapped up in the way that he looked, to have that taken away from you? by, first off, a back injury, and secondly, by what I'm guessing, if you've followed what Stu told you to do, was an unbelievably slow, painful, very [00:35:00] humbling process of slow rehabilitation.

[00:35:02] So yeah, this

[00:35:03] **David Laid:** could tie in real nicely. So, so with me, due to having all the body dysmorphia, insecurity, just like needing to work out to feel like the validation, self love, self worth, etc., right, that other extremes that that pushed me into is just like how like intense like I would exercise. Right. I would, you know, horrible form lift as much as I could just pain tolerance, like push through all of that.

[00:35:22] Right. And deadlift sumo as well. So here's the thing. So from one point of view, it's like, wow, that's so admirable. Like you just work so hard. You're so disciplined. You're so dedicated. That's just so amazing. Good for you. But if you, you know, look behind the curtain a little bit, that's not this, that's not that altruistic and pure of like an energy source.

[00:35:39] Right. It's a toxic energy source and that toxic energy source is an insecurity. And then basically That led me to just severe injuries of my spine because horrible form lifting heavy weight blah blah so with that right It's almost like my back injury is a [00:36:00] personification of being fueled by a toxic Fuel source, right?

[00:36:09] And then the thing is like someone could have told me back in the days Oh, like, you know, you shouldn't be like lifting this heavy. You shouldn't be doing this You should have been more careful, right? And that's me being like aware that maybe I shouldn't be doing that in the same way as someone that's like living a very hedonistic Young immature egotistical lifestyle is also vaguely aware that they maybe shouldn't be doing that I had that same awareness too But even though I knew that it just didn't matter because my my goal was like so egotistical at the end of the day Which is why the back situation like needed to happen to me like it there was simply thankful that it happened I mean, well, yes, in a certain kind of way, but I feel like it was inevitable to happen because, I mean, one school of thought is like for people to make like a proper drastic change, like they need to hit like a form of like rock bottom, right?

[00:36:52] It's, I had this having to stop the other day. Maybe it's like heard it somewhere. I don't remember, but it's like something along the lines of like wisdom [00:37:00] is. Often if not exclusively attained after like, like a rock bottom ish type of situation, but then ideally you'd want that wisdom like beforehand, but paradoxically it can only be gained after like a rock bottom like kind of thing.

[00:37:12] So it's like this weird tango inverted loop thing. But yes, I mean like for me that kind of definitely aided in a lot of the um, Just introspection or like growth or whatever just like having like that back situation happened because it forced me to just like slow down Like I like I was in such debilitating pain that like not only could I not deadlift or squat like the way that I wanted To I couldn't deadlift squat at all.

[00:37:34] I couldn't work out. Sometimes I wanted to I'd just be laying in bed with just chronic debilitating pain and To get out of that really wasn't that difficult at all I mean it was but when I say not that difficult all mine It's just like stop doing stupid things that hurt you and like rest But how my brain was wired at the time like that's not an option Like I just need to go go go go go go go go go go So it hit a point where so you can almost argue that it wasn't this just altruistic [00:38:00] transformation It literally hit a point where the back pain was so debilitating That I would rather kill my previous ego And start from scratch, then I would maintain that ego and tolerate the back pain, because before it was back pain was here, ego was here, still more with, but when those scales like tip just the right amount, it was an organic shift because I literally just had no other choice.

[00:38:20] So I literally constrained by your body. Yeah. So like I had to start from ground zero. And I mean, yeah, that's changed. Like, yeah. Not being so extremist all out in the gym, like being very like patient, disciplined, careful with like how it go about something as simple as like training where in the past, like, Oh, I feel good today.

[00:38:39] Max, just all the time. And so I feel like that new mindset now that I got from dealing with my back injuries has definitely permeated out like into other areas, but I think it arguably needed to happen to checkmate me into a form of like introspection. So me too.

[00:38:57] **Chris Williamson:** Me too, man. Uh, it came at the right time.

[00:38:59] [00:39:00] I had spent all of my 20s being a commercial male model, uh, walking around with my night with my top off at nightclubs, uh, getting photographed by Dean. And, um, a lot of my self worth was wrapped up in that. You know, even though I wasn't doing the online thing to the degree that you were, I still was, like, the guy that was in shape.

[00:39:24] I was always the like, one of the biggest or one of the leanest amongst my friends. And that gets taken away from you and you think, Oh fuck, who am I now? Who am I now when all of the things, all of the places that I took my self worth from are gone? Well, fuck. Like, what's left? Because this isn't gonna be here forever.

[00:39:44] I had, uh, thought of a quote the other day which was, um, Your looks are a depreciating asset, your mind is an appreciating asset. Invest your self worth appropriately. Everybody, no matter whether you think that your [00:40:00] sexual market value as a guy is going to peak at 45, like, there is going to come a time where you get over the top of that hill, and it's going to start descending.

[00:40:06] Like, even fucking David Gandy, right, is going to start descending at some point. You have the opportunity to invest in something which is evergreen. Which is going to compound, which is going to benefit the rest of the world. And that's not to say that people that are in shape can't benefit the rest of the world.

[00:40:20] It's good to be motivational, so on and so forth. But especially for women, I think, there was this story about Polina Porokhova, who was a supermodel back in the 90s. And she's now 56, and her husband had died, and there was a famous story that came out about her about a year and a half ago. And she was lamenting the fact that as a 56 year old, she walks into parties, and none of the guys look at her anymore.

[00:40:45] Because they're all distracted by the 23 year olds that are in the room. And she was saying, you know, a lot of my self worth, I feel really terrible, and so on and so forth. And it made me sad. It made me sad because I was looking at somebody who was still taking their [00:41:00] fundamental sense of self worth from the way that they looked with, I think, two or three kids.

[00:41:05] Um, it just, it doesn't feel graceful. Do you know what I mean? Like, it doesn't feel like somebody has, has allowed themselves to, to, Get harmony and grace and transcend and include the things that they had before. And also, there's obviously a massive amount of like hubris and hypocrisy here because when you were 22, you didn't care about the 56 year old that was in the room that all of the guys looking at you were ignoring to look at.

[00:41:28] It's like, look, this is the arc of life. Everybody knows that it's coming. Everybody knows that your looks are going to fade, that you're going to become sick or ill or destitute, that you're going to run out of money, that the people around you are going to die, and all that you're going to be left with is the power of your thoughts, right?

[00:41:48] How much resilience do you have that you can rely on so that when the hard thing happens, you have somewhere firm to [00:42:00] stand? And if the firmest place that you have to stand is I am single digit body fat. You were in for a hard fucking time.

[00:42:10] **David Laid:** Yeah, um, any, you know, external metric or just anything that you, like, latch on to, you know, whether it be your body fat percentage or your youthful looks that diminish with age that you just Even bank account, man.

[00:42:24] Yeah, bank account, like, forms of status, like, etc. Just, yeah, if you become, I mean, it's like a Buddhist saying, like, you just become, like, attached to stuff. It's just a problem. It's just not good, but There is an enjoyment in, you know, having like, like a huge bank account or enjoying your looks to a very, very high

[00:42:41] **Chris Williamson:** degree.

[00:42:41] Don't, don't, don't get me wrong. Like, you need external accolades, right? Like, I'm not, I'm not saying that we can like dispense with status. Yeah, there's a

[00:42:48] **David Laid:** primal hierarchy or whatever. That's a legit thing too. Yeah. Yeah, but it just I guess I guess it will put it like yet like that stuff is necessary useful to like certain like healthy degrees But obviously not

[00:42:59] **Chris Williamson:** [00:43:00] sufficient necessary, but not sufficient.

[00:43:02] **David Laid:** Yeah, that's necessary, but not sufficient and It's just yeah I mean is it's like a spectrum of like the more you like rely on those kind of things for like the like well being and like happiness, it's just you just you just run into problems and it just And like, like you were saying, like you want to be in a state where when all is like said and done and it's just you, that you have like something like firmer to stand on.

[00:43:26] So yeah.

[00:43:30] **Chris Williamson:** What are your thoughts about the modern world of dating, especially for young guys? Do you think about this much? There's a lot of advice out there for young dudes with regards to dating, especially to do with gym videos, approaching girls in the gym and the lack thereof and the challenges of guys approaching and so on and so forth.

[00:43:49] What's your conception on this?

[00:43:52] **David Laid:** I mean, I guess modern dating, like the internet has obviously played like a massive role, like the whole dating apps, [00:44:00] that being a situation, um, I mean I think obviously speaking things like the internet have like Drastically reduced like genuine like human like discourse.

[00:44:10] We're like in the past a lot more conversations We're like in person that were like real because like when like two people are say they're communicating over text It's such a narrow dialogue when you're like with someone in person there's like all these just energetic components intangible micro facial expressions like all of that and that's Preferable slash arguably needed to have like a maximally rich and satisfying and satiating like human experience overall with people like in any relationship friendship s kind of context.

[00:44:37] So I think just like the simple idea of that, that being reduced due to the introduction of the internet, although the internet obviously has a lot of benefits. You can meet people around the world, different areas, et cetera. There is like that, like obvious downside. And with that being said. There would be like an isolation component as well to, you know, socializing with real people less, [00:45:00] and then living in your own head, and then communicating and just meeting and talking to people on like dating apps and stuff.

[00:45:07] It, and then you could just start downloading and integrating certain just like toxic ideologies on male female intersexual dynamics that could have some tidbits of truth, but without contrasting it and integrating it with your own like real experience because you have none because you're Just isolated and extracting ideologies online that that could be just a massive detriment to your dating life I suppose.

[00:45:30] Bang, bang,

[00:45:30] **Chris Williamson:** bang. Dude, I've been harping on about this for so long. I did an interview for New the redone sub stack of what used to be ideas sleep furiously and they've changed the name and I can't remember what it is And they did it we did a little interview and they talked about um Why is it that men seem to be struggling with the advice that they get online and remember?

[00:45:51] For the girls that are listening, you need the advice that men get online to be good because you are the one that's gonna have to put up with these fucking men, right? So, my [00:46:00] point was, if you're chronically online, and most of your experiences around male to female interactions have been mediated through the internet, what are the kinds of stories that are the ones that go the most viral online?

[00:46:12] They're the most egregious, they're the one where some terrible catastrophe happens and the guy comes home and loses his house and his left foot and she, she takes his, like, all of his hairline in the divorce and that's the story that's going to go viral.

[00:46:27] **David Laid:** Yeah, and you can almost parallel this with prescriptions because if you don't have Real, you know sufficient amount whatever that means of a real experience with real people and you're just you know Getting ideologies online or just hearing worst case catastrophic scenarios, etc a lot of like um Theoretical frameworks that could be laid forward kid in isolation in the abstract makes so much sense and the math could like run out And like it works out especially when Extreme scenarios like added upon that and then when it comes like dating advice Just like [00:47:00] what you should say to approach and this is that like the more prescriptions like you add on it Just becomes just like such a disaster and but then people think oh, but how do I do this whole thing?

[00:47:07] If I don't have any like prescriptions or like know what to say or how to go about it, right? But the thing is, paradoxically so, if you like lay that like to the waist side, right, and then you're like around like people like speaking to people, girls, et cetera, whatever it may be, a certain organic chemistry arises if you would like let it arise, but the more weird prescriptions and layers like you add on top of that, you're just like fucking the whole thing up and it just becomes off.

[00:47:31] So paradoxically, you Leaving that to the wayside, your body and your instincts will take over and they'll just like know what to do, right? But so that's almost another way of putting it. The advent and introduction of the internet, dating apps, et cetera, has suppressed the natural organic instinct in favor of just.

[00:47:47] Weird, toxic, arguably toxic, like programming with, you know, how to go about things and that just creates just in a GMO inorganic

[00:47:56] **Chris Williamson:** disaster. Yeah, so this prescriptions thing, I think we just need to drill [00:48:00] this home for the people that maybe aren't familiar with Kapil's work. The point is, if you don't have any real world experience, the only place that you're going to get any tactics from are things that have been told to you that you've never actually come up with in the real world.

[00:48:14] But, if you were to spend, let's say that you could live for eternity, and have an unlimited number of interactions, if what the prescriptions are are accurate, you would inevitably arrive at them in any case. If I gave you a million years to work out, and you didn't know it, the most effective way to get a bar from the floor overhead in one single movement, you would eventually arise at something close to a snatch, because it is simply reality and theory coming up together.

[00:48:37] Constantine Kissin, the guy that does trigonometry, quoted this unbelievable line the other day that said, in theory Theory and practice are the same in practice. They're different.

[00:48:48] **David Laid:** Mm hmm Just a thought that I was having as we're saying that is So you could like parallel this whole prescription idea like from the dating back to like like working out for instance Like you have someone that's never worked out before right but they'll sit and they'll learn like all [00:49:00] like the theory and the this is that Etc and like what their personal ideal regimen would be and then come up with that and then if they try to execute it if they even bother to do so like sometimes it will like fall through because Just their bodies are different like how their lifestyles are set up.

[00:49:15] So you Yeah, even prescriptions could be like detrimental in something even as simple in the realm of fitness because if you just like start like doing It right If you want to go all out and be like, the best of all time, then obviously you're going to need to follow like, certain things, but

[00:49:33] **Chris Williamson:** The problem I have with the, the problem I have generally with Kapil's, and I, I had this problem when I spoke to Kapil on the show.

[00:49:38] The issue I have with Kapil's no prescriptions point is that Unlimited degrees of freedom allow people to find things through experience. However, you need guidelines and guardrails. Why are we talking about this crisis of masculinity where guys are lost and alone? It's because everything has been blown open.

[00:49:56] If everything is masculinity, then nothing is masculinity. [00:50:00] Right? And you go, okay, from first principles, please work out how you are supposed to show up in the world. And you go, dude, that's really, really hard. And you, what, you want me to do that for diet, and my role in society, and the way that I should make money, and the way I should interact with my friends, and the way that I should get a girlfriend, and the way that I should become a father, da da da da.

[00:50:17] Like, it's fucking exhausting. The best way that I've found for this, and this is where I diverge from Kapil's work, The best way that I've found from this is that in the beginning of anything you need instruction, because you have no experience to rely on, you don't want to become dogmatic about the instruction, but you do need to take it.

[00:50:33] So you explore at the start, and then you exploit over time. Do lots of different things, find out what works for you, and then over time, once you have learned the rules, You can break the rules, but breaking the rules before you learn the rules is just not playing the game. Now,

[00:50:48] **David Laid:** I agree with that. I did such a poor job of expressing what I wanted to with that, um, parallel with the prescriptions, with the working out.

[00:50:56] But yeah, I mean, obviously if you're getting like into fitness, like you, you're going to follow like some like vague [00:51:00] program in general. I think the idea that I was like trying to get at is. You're better off like taking a random workout program, whatever it may be just going out doing it, seeing how you respond to it, just seeing how much you like working out in general.

[00:51:11] Maybe you don't want to be a heavyweight bodybuilder. Maybe you just want to work out a few times that we can get in shape and that'll like satisfy you, but you won't know that unless you actually try. So that's all fine. But what I was getting at is. Not doing anything just having like all like the theory like what works out and then it's just not being like a practical like execution In your actual life was more something like that But I agree with the nuance like obviously like you can't derive absolutely everything and just know how to just be like Workout from first principle obviously like when you're a kid like you need to be taught language You need to talk your shoes.

[00:51:38] Those are prescriptions from a certain point of view. Yeah, so yeah, that was where
