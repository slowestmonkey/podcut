[00:00:00] Chris Williamson: We are both fans of Charlie Houpert, and he says that when somebody asks you, what do you do? You have the opportunity to hook lots of different things in. So if someone was to ask you, why do you do what you do? What's the single thread that ties together all of the things that you do? What would you say that?

[00:00:23] David Laid: That's interesting. I feel like there's been like in evolution like throughout that because. Just what I do. I guess it's like change, like over time because like now, like like, broadly speaking, like on the surface, like I make, like YouTube, like fitness oriented videos. But I think that started when I was like 13 or 14 years old, like I got into like weightlifting. And then I took a lot of pictures of my progress, made a transformation video, then ended up going viral. And then I just like started making a YouTube channel just with, like my friends in the gym, just making random videos, like working out. And then I guess I started being more interested in making cinematic ish like content and just making it more like, I don't know, sophisticated, like higher quality, like, etc. like more artistic. And. Yeah, I guess. I just enjoy making videos that I just enjoy making.

[00:01:19] Chris Williamson: Do you wish sometimes that your entrance into the world of virality, social media, YouTube hadn't been so tightly defined based on the way that you look the gym? Or do you like integrate that as part of your history? Perfectly fine.

[00:01:41] David Laid: I'd say so. I mean, I'd say at an earlier point, maybe like years and years and years ago, it was to the point where there was like a like, I guess a slight like toxicity component to it, because the whole reason that I got into working out was because of like very like generic stereotypical insecurities as being like extremely skinny, feeling all that. And then as I started getting more and more progress in the gym and then that obviously gave me like a self-esteem boost, I felt a lot better about myself. And then I would like take pictures. And then obviously when people take pictures, oftentimes they just want to like maximize it to get, you know, the best lighting angles, etc.. And then I got to a point where maybe like a few years into working out where I had just a decent bit, enough of muscle to get pictures that look like semi-decent, right. But not in those pictures. Like in real life, like without like a pump or whatever. I remember just like feeling like still like very like just like skinny and insecure. And then it was like a problem because even say, like my senior year in high school, I remember I would just wear hoodies just all the time because if you're wearing like a big baggy hoodie, you can't like exactly tell like, like the size of an individual.

[00:02:45] Chris Williamson: Even though at this stage you're probably one of the biggest guys in school.

[00:02:48] David Laid: Yeah. I mean, I wasn't like gargantuan or anything, but I definitely I look like a normal, reasonable human being with like an acceptable amount of, like muscle tone. Right? But still in my head there was like this crazy just distortion, body dysmorphia. And then eventually the way that transferred over to social media is it was like that thing just amplified even more in terms of just needing to look as good as I possibly could, like in pictures.

[00:03:10] Chris Williamson: Scrutinizing you for it.

[00:03:11] David Laid: Yeah. So if like, I take a picture with someone and then my physique didn't look like as good as, like I thought it would like in my own pictures that I would take or just by myself in like particular curated environments that would definitely wreak havoc on my well-being. And that was definitely suboptimal. But as more and more time went by, I feel like that general complex just naturally like dissolved. And there's been a bit more peace. Where are you.

[00:03:35] Chris Williamson: At now with, you know, because you're still what are you, 24?

[00:03:38] David Laid: Uh, just turned 25.

[00:03:39] Chris Williamson: Right. Okay. So you've been on the internet for longer than I have, despite being ten years younger than me. Right. Given the fact that you have had this long career from basically, when was when did that first video go viral?

[00:03:52] David Laid: 1718 the age that I was I was about 17.

[00:03:56] Chris Williamson: Yeah. So, you know, a good chunk of time that you've spent with an awful lot of eyes on you on the internet. All of this has been based around the way that you look. You know, this is coming out the back end of the like, aesthetic, bro, like, James era type thing. How have you managed to dispense with, or how much have you managed to get rid of that body dysmorphia, that sense of your sense of self-worth, being attached to the way that you look, your leanness, your size?

[00:04:22] David Laid: I think the way that that dissolution happened, to whatever degree it has happened, was through just so many years on end or such a prolonged period of time of just. Feeling such internal like discomfort and dissonance and just, yeah, just an overall sense of like discomfort in my actual day to day life having to just like, micromanage just my own like self-image of how I think I look, yadda yadda. This is that. And then it just got to the point where that was just so unsatisfying to operate in that way, that. The more and more I would distance myself from that, like organically as a byproduct of like achieving a certain like understanding of how that makes me feel. Then I would just notice. It would just not feel that way anymore. But even like throughout the years, like at times I would have. Situations where I could just see my brain re-entering previous thought patterns that I did when I was, like, fully ensconced in that mindset. But back when I was fully ensconced in that mindset, that was literally my like, reality as I was like having those thoughts and feelings. But now that previous thought pattern still exists, but it it exists within a broader understanding so that when it arises, I could just recognize its arrival and then it'll just go away. And then, um. Just like, I don't know, at peace or I feel fine. Like there's like, no, like, issues really. So I don't know, I didn't like necessarily implement like just like a strategic like plan or like take any steps or like create I don't know, like a mental hygienic discipline to do that. It's just it just sort of just organically just happened after just like contemplation and stuff.

[00:05:56] Chris Williamson: Talk to me about the introspection and the self-work that you've done over the last few years. Ah, because just to interject them, I'm like, you're a you're a young guy, right? You're 25. I was like an adult infant at 25. And the way that you're talking about letting go, releasing difficult challenges that come up is very mature, especially for somebody that's had broadly the internet world at their feet for quite a long time. And I'm fascinated to work out how you go from that aesthetic growth thing to now still a relatively young age, taking value in different stuff. What have been the practices, the thought patterns, the influencers that have got you here?

[00:06:38] David Laid: I'd say one of the main reasons that happened is just my natural disposition of being extremely introverted. So for me, I spent a lot of time by myself. That's my recharge period, yadda yadda. Like we all know. Like how like introversion works, like basically. So for me, just. Just long periods of time. Just by myself. Just thinking about shit. Are you an only child? No. I have three brothers. Okay. Yeah. Just thinking. Just obviously listening to. Just lots of podcasts. Like lots of great thinkers. Just borrowing, like, thought patterns from other people and just building this larger, like, conception, like, in my head, and then contrasting that with my own insights and things that. I've just experienced and. Yeah. Just just lots of just just lots of, like, thinking because I feel like that's how most things are like, typically like, resolved. Like there's an idea that. I forget, like there's lots of people that talk about. So I'm sure you've heard people talk about this too. But if you. If you want to like, for example, like you're familiar with like Naval Ravikant, like him talking about like prescriptions or like if he's spoken to an individual, like, like haplogroup. I don't know if you've seen that podcast. Oh, he has a very.

[00:07:44] Chris Williamson: Long time ago. Who? Kapil Gupta.

[00:07:46] David Laid: No way. Correct. Has he.

[00:07:47] Chris Williamson: Actually. Yeah. The no prescriptions prescriptions guy.

[00:07:49] David Laid: Was it an audio only podcast? Correct. Yeah. So I mean, that whole idea like basically. I feel like. So if an individual is like struggling with like any sorts of like body dysmorphia, image issues like, etc., one line of thought is like, okay, you're like, I have an issue. Like I have a problem. I have like anxiety, I have distress, I have all these like things going on. So one school of thought is like, okay, let me okay, I have issues, right? I need to fix issues. So let me like implement like certain like things and regimes to like combat these problems, which is like useful in moderation to a degree. But I feel like for just a really, really deep internal authentic transformation, you can't do that by following just certain, like, oh, let me just write down like in my gratitude journal, like 15 minutes a day, like every single day. Like, let me just like have this like mantra, like meditation kind of pattern. Maybe that works for some people to some degree, but in a certain kind of way, there's a type of like insincerity that goes with that because you become obsessed with doing the doing the the surface level generic action to get out of your state of distress, as opposed to just sitting and being in the distress without any agenda and just just being there and in that state, just naturally, you somehow. Just wiggle out of it or dissolve or just transcend, like the issue per se, or you don't even transcend it. You could just understand it on a deeper level. And it's that deeper understanding that gives like health, I suppose, if that makes any sense, it does.

[00:09:19] Chris Williamson: Well, I think that an interesting question might be how many of the strategies that you use to deal with the things that you don't like about yourself or about your life are not helping you to deal with them, but are helping you to escape from them. So yeah, so.

[00:09:34] David Laid: I just remember so I remember so when I was like young, when I was like 13, 14 ish, like 12 or whatever, I was like very insecure. I was like skinny, whatever. Right? So like I saw, like, you know, muscular people that I look up to and I'm like, oh, like, I want that, right? So then I followed a bunch of people. I gained like a lot of inspiration. And then I did like what I needed to do to like, build my physique. And then I think I was around the age of like 18, 19, 20, like sometime around that time. And then I think that's when Jordan Peterson, like, first started popping off. And, um, I was like listening to a lot of his content. And I was like, whoa, there's something about this, like resonates so much. I remember, like, feeling just that I would just like, have like, certain just interesting ideas or like things going on in my brain, but they couldn't, like, come out just right. And then when I would listen to someone like Jordan Peterson speak, I had a very specific admiration for the his ability to so precisely with perfect congruence of what's happening internally and what he's saying externally, to be at a 1 to 1 ratio with just like music orchestral grade precision with like his like delivery, just almost like irregardless of what he was like saying it's like the structure, not the content of a speech that I just had like an admiration for, in addition to the things that are obviously said as well. So then that I feel like. Launched my brain into wanting to just like develop in those like general regions, like categories and stuff. So I would just listen to like so many other people, the Sam Harris's, um, Alan Watts, etc.

[00:10:53] David Laid: like all these like different people. So then I remember, like, reaching a point of like I was like 20, 21 ish. And then I had a general feeling of just like the whole body dysmorphia, yadda yadda. All this, like, stuff was just like catching up to me. All these like generic whatever, like all these problems that me and like so many people deal with. And then I went down like the prescription path. Right. And the prescription path would have been like, like I started going into yoga all the time. And then I had this, like, huge ego complex, like showing up on time, like doing all like my poses, like extremely, extremely well because I'm like, if I'm like doing this right and then also like, I'll sit down like I'll meditate in the morning for like 30 minutes or whatever. I was like so obsessed and excited to do that because obviously, you know, the thought pattern is doing these things will like, alleviate me and like get me out of like my problems or whatever. So then I feel like that's a very common thing for like so many people to do, and then they become obsessed with doing that. I became obsessed with doing that. And then I felt like huge bursts of dopamine throughout that. Right? Because I'm like, oh, checkbox like yoga session finished. Like this thing finished like this, like food, like eating. Right? And I would just feel like so excited. But it was almost like a short terme. Just pleasure seeking fixation on like doing that and that they didn't actually didn't like really like solve anything underneath.

[00:11:59] Chris Williamson: You've still got the, the existing problem. Okay. So you've got in the first instance an issue with body dysmorphia or a dissatisfaction with the way that you look. Um, you fix that by finding people that you like, the way that they look and modeling what they do. Um, then you find people that you admire the way that they think, and you compare the way that you think to were the way that they think. You then start to model off of the way that they think. What are the similarities between or what is it that you were looking for, do you think in both camps of people like, what is it that Zies and Jordan Peterson have got in common that seduced you?

[00:12:35] David Laid: That's a great line. What are the things that Zies and Jordan Peterson have in common? I'd say that it's the you to me. You. In attainment of something that I, for whatever reason, deemed to me deemed to be. Admirable and non-negotiable necessary for me to have. And in this case it's, you know, muscles, uh, Jordan Peterson brain, etc.. But so it's just their accomplishment of something. Yeah. And I feel like you could almost tie that into. I don't know if you could tie that into the general concept of like, masculinity, but I'd say, yeah, I'd say to me it's just something that they like achieved that I, for whatever reason, just wanted. To have.

[00:13:23] Chris Williamson: Well, it sounds to me like if you want to roll masculinity into this, you're trying from first principles to come up with like, what is a modern Renaissance man? You know, how do we have the body, the brains, the humility, the benevolence, the altruism, the insight, the self-awareness, you know, the power, but not the tyranny, the money, but not the greed. You know, how do we hold all of these things together? One of the challenges that I've been talking about a lot on the show at the moment is finding a firm place for men to stand in the modern world. And this isn't just good for men, right? Because if you have good, benevolent, strong men, they make pretty good partners, usually on average, like they're good for the women as well, and they're good for the community and they're good for the society, and they're good for the civilization and the GDP and the economics and all the rest of the stuff. Given the fact that you have spent a lot of time chronically online for the last ten years. What's your. Conception of male role models at the moment, the challenge of masculinity. Why do you think it is that a lot of young men are feeling lost, uh, and are requiring more and more of these role models?

[00:14:34] David Laid: I think there's many different like, interpretations, like one school of thought or camp is like, oh, there's there's been a disruption of the nuclear family unit and there's like some conspiratorial reasons for that, some non-conspiratorial reasons, because you can go under the hypothesis that to, you know, have, uh, more or less successful upbringing, you want the standard nuclear family unit, mom and dad. And then without being like fragmented, fractured, then that creates all sorts of problems. So if that is the case, then the quote unquote child boy like in this instance, isn't getting a certain type of isn't getting like a healthy, proper dose of masculine energy, like within like the household under the assumption that the household is fragmented for whatever reasons, then that need still needs to be satiated. And because it's not being satiated at home due to the easy access of the internet, then that role models will be found like online. So like inbuilt in like intrinsic like in the human condition is like that like need for that like kind of energy. And if it's not being like given at home it's going to be need to be supplemented elsewhere in this case online and depending on the maybe maturity level of the individual or just how the individual is wired, like certain people gravitate towards these types of online figures, other roles like rotate in this I mean not rotate, resonate or connect with other people that they find on the internet. And I think that the reason that people like Zs and like Jordan Peterson and all like that are, um. Influential and have like resonance is because they're arguably supplementing that need that a lot of people aren't getting in the stereotypically standard, classic home nuclear family esque kind of way. Yes.

[00:16:12] Chris Williamson: Yes, I think yes. I also think that even if you do have a nuclear family, the rules and procedures that the generation before us had, you know, if your dad grew up and never had the internet until you were born. How is he going to be able to fold in understanding the way that social media works, understanding the way the online dating works, the crazy, crazy changes that we've seen with regards to men's roles, the MeToo movement, all of this stuff. I think that even the best meaning father in the world from the previous generation might struggle to have the language to be able to communicate with a kid that is growing up.

[00:16:52] David Laid: Yeah, no. For sure. Times are changing so fast. Things are changing so quickly that you know the previous rule set or whatever. Although it may have like certain fundamental pillars or parameters that will be universally applicable for any timeline whatsoever. When things change as they inevitably do. Like things, approaches need to be just like micromanaged and nuanced, like tweaked. And then no one knows, like exactly to what degree that needs to be done. Like, it's so easy to overshoot or undershoot. And because the rules like haven't been made yet, we're essentially figuring out, like on the fly, like what's like happening.

[00:17:24] Chris Williamson: Correct? I also think that it's more than perhaps just a micro tweak. I think that the last 30 to 40 years has been a bit of a left turn as soon as you introduce the internet. One interesting thing that I was considering on the plane ride over here, for the guys that didn't come up, uh, living on XYZ and that aesthetics bro era, a lot of that was about pulling girls at festivals. It was sort of quite chauvinistic. It was, uh, harmless and funny and self-deprecating, but there was still a lot of that, like, sort of gym flirtation energy in there. Um, how do you think in 2023, given the politics that we have at the moment, given the hypersensitivity around approaching girls in the gym, given the advent of MeToo, how do you think if you deposited XYZ in 2023, that kind of content would be received now? Do you think that he would survive without cancellation?

[00:18:20] David Laid: Uh, someone like XYZ. I think that he would survive without cancellation. Probably because I think, like extremist people like that. That. I mean, they garner like a certain, like audience, like the more niche or extreme you could be like, you'll cultivate an audience. And obviously, like a lot of people also dislike you as well. And that'll like add to your benefit in terms of like social media, like expansion. So I mean, there's like plenty of people that many people deem to be detestable, but they're still extremely prevalent on the internet. So. No, I mean, I think all things considered, I don't think this would be like canceled per se today because, I mean, there's so many other people that are like taking on like the XYZ esque manly energy and just like passing, you know, taking the torch that he, you know, passed on that are still living in those general, like, kinds of ways. So I think that I think he would probably flourish just fine, objectively speaking.

[00:19:09] Chris Williamson: Talking about this, I'm fascinated about this trajectory. Right. That that you've gone on specifically, um, what changes if you were able to create what you think the world of men that are around about your age need right now in terms of influencers and influencers, what do you wish that you could see more of in terms of the sort of content that's out there, in terms of the kind of messaging, the kind of values, the sort of things that men should be aspiring toward and the things that they should stop aspiring toward as well. What would you try and prescribe?

[00:19:42] David Laid: I think generally speaking, like a reduction in materialism would probably be a good thing. And I think the additional emphasis on. Just developing like a competence and like any domain whatsoever, whether it's like pottery, you know, exercising, working out, like whatever it is. So it would be I think it'd be better. To. Shine more of a light on. People's genuine like ability and attainments and skill level in whatever their idiosyncratic or generic just pursuit and endeavor is, and just have an appreciation for that in and of itself, without any, with a significantly less emphasis on the periphery of the tangible material assets that that, that that type of success could like, yield.

[00:20:30] Chris Williamson: So Hormozi on an episode that I did with him a couple of weeks ago, said, far more people are kept poor and stupid by their ego than get rich off it. And, you know, he made this great point that if you are somebody that considers yourself to be a high performer, that is pushing and always trying to grow and you're able to retain your ego, it's because you're in the wrong room. And his point was, even though he's now worth 100 mil, he's got this acquisition. Com, he's doing these massive deals. He's permanently in rooms where he is both the stupidest and poorest person in the room. How can you allow an ego to proliferate and grow when you're permanently the lowest rung of the ladder? And his argument was basically that ego comes from people, uh, artificially walling off the size of the pond that they get into to allow themselves to always be the biggest fish.

[00:21:21] David Laid: But also, I feel like it comes down to their deepest, most fundamental motivation because, for example, you could take someone like Alex, he desperately is wired to do something and wants to do something just like work, build his empire, business, whatever. That's like his sort of thing. So he just he simply needs to do that to be satiated, happy and like, satisfied. Right? So that's just what he's on. And in order to be able to do that as effectively as he possibly can manage, that would necessitate and require a very high level of like self awareness. And obviously self awareness is the antithesis to ego. So that's just simply what he what he wants to do. And then you could take someone else that is like the small pond like ego situation. Their primary, most fundamental desire isn't doing something for its own sake or any, you know, deeper reason like that. It's simply towards the the growth and maintenance of the ego. Right. And that's just simply that's just what their motivation is like. They're simply they're more interested in like having a certain self image of themselves and doing everything to convince other people of that image and convince themselves of that image, because to them that's more important than other things. So it's just like a different hierarchy of like priorities, right? So like, yeah, the lower level development psyche is going to want to favor just egotistical ish types of things.

[00:22:34] Chris Williamson: How do you square this circle with the person that's listening to this and going, hang on, you're David fucking laid like you're Mr. Instagram XYZ era? Like, how have you made that change? How have you made that transition from being somebody who outwardly it seemed like it was, and you mentioned yourself it was to satiate your feelings of insufficiency, to now get to a place where, I mean, how many videos have you posted on YouTube in the last year? Probably less than 12. How many Instagram posts have you done in the last year? Less than 20.

[00:23:05] David Laid: It's been out of decline.

[00:23:08] Chris Williamson: But my point being that. From where I can see, and I didn't get to hear you on podcasts before. I think that your trajectory, in terms of how you're sounding to me, in terms of the things that you're thinking about, is fucking phenomenal. I would have happily taken the sabbatical from social media if what it's resulted in is you being like this, but how do you get to that point? There are guys on the internet that are watching the ego lifter, the materialist Ferrari driver, the Richard Mille red Louboutins bottom table at Club Live in Miami. What is it that can drag those people out of that? Or what would you say to those like, young guys if you could? Why should they be bothered about this thing, which seems hard and difficult and nuanced and no one gives a fuck about except for their own sense of existential self-worth?

[00:23:58] David Laid: I think. I think a lot of those people that like, operate like that, like they have like a vague understanding that like maybe the way in which they're operating from a lot of other people's points of view is like seen as like negative, egotistical, immature, like, etc.. So they have like that, like general like awareness. And they're may be aware that they to satisfy, you know, society at a hole's, you know, expectations of them. They would maybe like cease or halt or like slow down on some of that behavior or like, you know, outgrow it or etc. but they're like aware of that. But they just, they just, they just don't want to do it. Because going back to what I was saying before, that's just simply like they're just more interested in doing that. That's like where the current level of like their development is. So. In the same way. Like to me, the only the way that I outgrew whatever, like I outgrew like whatever time like it came from just like, just organic, like introspection. So going back to kind of what I was like saying in the beginning, like, you just simply you need to just examine you need you just need to just like, like look at what you're doing and just like, look at how you're living and look at how you're operating and just like, like dissect it as much as you can and be as. Like, be honest with yourself, obviously. And like, look at it. And I feel like if you're genuinely and sincerely doing that right, you're more than likely to realize how that pattern, that style of like living is just disadvantageous for your absolute best interest. And through coming to that realization, you just organically stop doing that. You don't have to. Yeah, you don't have to discipline yourself to stop doing it. Like, oh, I really want to do it, but I want to go to this, but I can't like, no, you just won't have that desire. And that's the best place to be at because why do you want to like it's it's just where you got to arrive, you know.

[00:25:29] Chris Williamson: So there's my favorite ever blog post of all time is by a guy called Kyle Schroeder, and it's called What Do You Want to Want? And he talks about the difference between wants and what we want to want. So wants our societal programming, their paths of least resistance, that the way that you've dealt with past trauma, they are all of those things. What you want to want involves you going in and reprogramming your desires. You want to end up at a place where what you want is what you want to want. And he uses this example of the fact that if you don't go in and program your desires, the best thing that you can hope for is to be a rich, successful, or famous slave. A slave to the impulses of your body, the confused biochemical signals that you get, the desires of the people around you. And when I read that, and this is, you know, five years ago now, I thought, what do I want to want in life? Genuinely, what do I want to want? Like I have the opportunity. Laws of thermodynamics. And like a little bit of economics restricting. I can want anything. This is what we're talking about here. We're talking about digging away at all of the layers of ego and predisposition and expectation that you've built up, and getting yourself to something that's firmer, getting yourself to something which is what you want to want.

[00:26:50] David Laid: Yeah. I mean, I think there's a lot of validity in that because basically, like what you're saying is, like you, a person wants certain things and they maybe he realizes some degree like these, just kind of this maybe, maybe isn't my best interest. Like silly, like little hypothesis lurking in the back of the mind. Okay. So if I'm an autonomous being, I could I could more or less curate or decide what I want to want. So if that's a possibility, let's just look, broadly speaking, what are some of the things that would maybe be in more of a best interest for me to one? And then you decide those things and you fixate on that pattern. I mean, fixate in that direction. And even if you you could argue that that's still prescription esque to some degree, but then you could also say that doing that is better than just continuing wanting those, like, suboptimal things. So if that if that's what gets you moving in that direction, then it's absolutely.

[00:27:39] Chris Williamson: Yeah. And direction is more important than speed. Right. Like you can be going as fast as possible in the wrong direction. And it actually takes you further away from the destination. And this is something that a lot of people I call it the. Uh manopause, um, which is mid-twenties toward late 20s. A lot of guys, it seems like you had yours earlier, realized that a lot of the values that they hold, a lot of the things that previously they took a sense of self-worth from, that the world told them that they should value. They don't make them feel fulfilled anymore. And they go, oh, fuck, like I, I got toward the top of this mountain, and I realized that it was the wrong mountain that I climbed. And actually, I was supposed to be on that one over there. Um, and it's difficult because in order to get to that one, you need to go back down, this one that you've already climbed. You need to dispense with the stuff that you've that you've got rid of.

[00:28:26] David Laid: This is where I think introversion is such a cheat code because, like, I feel like you're.

[00:28:29] Chris Williamson: Less at the mercy of other people's.

[00:28:31] David Laid: Desires because even like for me, I noticed that if I'm the more frequently and the more for a sustained period of time, I'm involved in certain just patterns of behavior, oftentimes socially, or just just what I do in general. You just become locked in those patterns and it becomes more difficult. You have more of like a narrow perspective. So, you know, the brain's malleable. It just gets programmed in that way and you're just kind of operating that way. So for me, a lot of like the best insights that I've gotten are like times when I like completely just like fully detached and just entered this weird, like meditative, just like flow state of just being just so just alone. And. Yeah, so it's just. I feel like. Yeah, I mean, almost a prescriptive thing that you could say is to just stop. I mean, that's what they say, like psychedelics do. I think I heard someone on Joe Rogan talk about he had like a nice analogy. It's like the brain is like like a hill covered in snow. And then when the skis go down the snow, that's a thought behavior pattern, etc.. And then the more you have it, the more deeper that groove gets. And then the psychedelics, they just like wipe the snow. So detaching from society, detaching and, you know, recusing yourself for a period of time, it's like a micro form of like a psychedelic snow flattening kind of thing.

[00:29:37] Chris Williamson: Because you're removing the external inputs as best you.

[00:29:39] David Laid: Can, removing the inputs, stopping the behavior patterns, just allowing yourself to see things differently and have different patterns.

[00:29:44] Chris Williamson: For the people who are thinking about monk mode, um, there's a really great blog post by Illimitable man, if you just search Illimitable man monk mode. It's 13 years old now, I think, but it's really, really great. There's the three eyes. Isolation. Introspection. Some of the. There's a third one anyway that I really, really enjoyed that blog post and that was good to me. One thing that I do find, and this is me almost directly like telling it to Hamza, my friend monk. Monk can be taken to an extreme and you can do. You can obsess over isolated self development too much.
